# Apple Homepage Clone

This repository contains a clone of the Apple homepage built using React.js for the frontend and Node.js with MySQL for the backend. The project is divided into three main parts:

1. **Frontend** - The frontend uses React.js to create a dynamic and interactive user interface. It's been designed to replicate the original Apple homepage, providing a similar user experience.

2. **Backend** - The backend is developed using Node.js and MySQL. It serves as the backend for the iPhone page, receiving and storing information sent from the form.

3. **Form** - A simple form designed with HTML and CSS, which can be opened directly in the browser. It's used to gather information like images, names, and prices, which are then sent to the backend.

## Frontend

The frontend part of the project uses React.js to create a dynamic and interactive user interface. It mimics the original Apple homepage, offering a user experience that is as close to the original as possible.

## Backend

The backend is crafted using Node.js and MySQL. It's set up to receive and store data specifically for the iPhone page. The reason for focusing on the iPhone page is to illustrate that the same setup could be extrapolated for other product pages as well.

## Form

The form is a simple HTML and CSS construct that can be opened directly in a web browser. It's used to collect data such as images, names, and prices, which are then dispatched to the backend. This form functions as an admin interface for adding and updating the product details on the iPhone page.

## How to Run

To run this project locally, Node.js and MySQL need to be installed on your machine. Clone the repository, navigate to each of the frontend, backend, and form directories separately, and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies. Then start each of them with `npm start`.

Please note that you'll need to set up your own MySQL database and update the connection details in the backend code.
